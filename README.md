# Claim_Processing_System

 Developed a centralized platform to manage and process insurance claims by consolidating data from
 various sources. Key features include:
 ● ClaimsProcessing Module: Manages claim validation, processing, and status updates.

 The system provides real-time claim status updates, automates evaluations, and is built on a monolithic
 architecture for ease of deployment and maintenance
